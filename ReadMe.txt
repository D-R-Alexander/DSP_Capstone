You will use the following code to generate your datasets. Develop your algorithm using the edx set. 
For a final test of your final algorithm, predict movie ratings in the validation set (the final 
hold-out test set) as if they were unknown. RMSE will be used to evaluate how close your predictions 
are to the true values in the validation set (the final hold-out test set).

Important: The validation data (the final hold-out test set) should NOT be used for training, developing, 
or selecting your algorithm and it should ONLY be used for evaluating the RMSE of your final algorithm. 
The final hold-out test set should only be used at the end of your project with your final model. It may 
not be used to test the RMSE of multiple models during model development. You should split the edx data 
into separate training and test sets to design and test your algorithm.
